New Feature: Edit Destination URLs
<p>Ever shared a link only to realize the destination page has moved or changed? We’ve got you covered!</p>
<p>With our new <b>Edit Destination</b> feature, you can now update the long URL of any existing link without changing its short alias or QR code. This means your printed materials and shared posts will never break again.</p>

<p><b>How it works:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to your Dashboard.</li>
    <li>Click the <b>pencil icon</b> next to the link you want to change.</li>
    <li>Enter the new destination URL and save.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Note: This feature is available for <b>Pro</b> and <b>Ultra</b> plan users. Free plan users can still manage their links by deleting and recreating them.</i></p>
