Update: Monthly Limits for Custom Slugs
<p>To keep <b>PureLnk</b> stable and prevent system abuse, we are introducing a monthly quota for custom aliases.</p>
<p>Starting today, the <b>Free Plan</b> includes up to <b>5 custom slugs</b> per month. This limit only applies to links where you manually set a "custom code". Standard randomly generated links remain unlimited within your overall plan capacity.</p>
<p>You can track your custom slug usage in your dashboard. If you need more flexibility for your brand, stay tuned for our upcoming premium tiers!</p>
