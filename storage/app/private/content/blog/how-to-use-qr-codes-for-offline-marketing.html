How to Use QR Codes to Drive Offline Traffic to Your Website
<p>In 2026, the bridge between physical marketing and digital results is shorter than ever. While social media is vital, offline touchpoints—like business cards, posters, and product packaging—remain powerful. The key to connecting them? <b>QR Codes.</b></p>

<h3>1. Why QR Codes are Making a Comeback</h3>
<p>Gone are the days of clunky third-party scanners. Today, every smartphone camera recognizes QR codes instantly. For your customers, it’s the difference between manually typing a long URL or visiting your site in <b>one second</b>.</p>

<h3>2. Dynamic QR Codes via PureLnk</h3>
<p>When you shorten a link on <b>PureLnk.com</b>, we automatically generate a high-resolution QR code for you. The advantage? If you ever need to change the destination URL, the QR code remains the same. You don't need to reprint your flyers!</p>

<h3>3. Top Use Cases for Your Business</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Restaurants:</b> Place QR codes on tables for instant digital menus.</li>
    <li><b>Real Estate:</b> Put codes on "For Sale" signs leading directly to 3D tours.</li>
    <li><b>Events:</b> Print them on badges so attendees can download schedules instantly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Design Tips for Scannability</h3>
<p>To ensure your <b>PureLnk QR codes</b> work perfectly, keep these tips in mind: ensure high contrast (dark code on a light background) and provide enough "quiet zone" or white space around the edges.</p>

<p><b>Pro Tip:</b> Always use a shortened <b>PureLnk</b> URL for your QR codes. Fewer characters in the URL mean a simpler, less dense QR pattern, which is much easier for older cameras to scan!</p>
